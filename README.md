Snotify is a C++ digital music service project. It is based on cPerson, cSong, cSmartArray and linkedList classes.
cPerson is a representation of a user of the music player. It stores user information such as Unique Snotify ID, personal information(name, city, gender) as well as the user's music library. Each user's library(or playlist) is represented by both sSmartArray (dynamic array) and linkedList classes (no STL containers were used!) and is accessible for editing (add/delete/sort and etc). Songs are represented by cSong class with the essential properties such as name, artist. Furthermore, each song has its rating which is determined by user as well as the number of times played. Program generates random users using .csv(for name and street address) and .txt files from the solution. Songs are randomly generated using .csv file with BillBoard Top Songs from ealier years. Further implementation can be found in the solution files...
